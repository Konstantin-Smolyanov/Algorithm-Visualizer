# Algorithm-Visualizer-2.0

What it does:
It takes as input an array of numbers as well as a choice of sorting algorithm
and then sorts said array using said algorithm while displaying changes in real time to the console.

How to use:
1. Insert space-separated numbers on a single line and press Enter when you're done or just type 'D' to use default array.
2. You'll be prompted to press a button to choose which algorithm you want to use for sorting the array.
3. The array gets sorted.
4. You can choose to press 'R' to input another array or any other key to exit the program.

!!!! no error handling implemented yet, only inert space separated integer numbers.

To be implemented:
1. Two more algorithms
2. Error handling for wrong input.
